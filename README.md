# cv-object-detection-stream

This project focuses on real-time object detection in (YouTube) video streams, leveraging technologies such as Python 3.6, OpenCV with YOLOv3 detection method, and Streamlink.

The configurations include the following:
* A Python environment
`$ pip install numpy pandas argparse datetime pafy streamlink flask_opencv_streamer youtube-dl flask_opencv_streamer opencv-contrib-python`
* An installation of OpenCV with YOLOv3 (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) 
* An instance of Streamlink (https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink)
